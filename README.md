# Simulation 2020 (Version 0.9)!
The Robomaster Simulation by Wai Yan.
Version 0.9.<br>
<b>To all that don't use Github but still want to try it out:
On page load, simply click on "Clone or Download", Then "Download ZIP". Find the "Robomaster.exe" file, and you're good to go.</b><br>
Known Bugs:
1) The drone has grossly unrealisitc physics
2) Bullet paths are way too accurate
3) The map is yet to be updated to the newest version
4) (I'm pretty sure) player damage is still not working.<br><br>
Things that will be added later on
1) All the different cooldown-buff areas around the map
2) End-game screen instead of just a Game Over.

And much more.
