#Only if you want to try to older version
<b>To all that don't use Github but still want to try it out:
On page load, simply click on "Clone or Download", Then "Download ZIP". Find the "Robomaster.exe" file, and you're good to go.</b><br>
Known Bugs:
1) The drone has grossly unrealistic physics, and does not activate according to gamerules.
2) Bullet paths are way too accurate
3) UI Colours aren't stable. 
<br><br>
Things that will be added later on
1) More options for the spectator
2) A pinging system so you can play without having to Voice chat.

And much more.
