The Robomaster Simulation by Wai Yan.
Version 1.1.<br>
https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/wykwokaf_connect_ust_hk/Ee1YIdThindGobW4A4YFz4QBQ1I2V0X7OuOamHWWPF1JXw?e=r8QrCo<br>
Controls: <br>
- WASD (Shift): Move (Sprint)
- O: +300 bullets (near the area)
- (Hero) G: Artillery Mode
- (Engineer) L: Pick up Slope
- (Engineer) U: Pick up Mineral
- (Drone) QE: Up/Down

A couple of things have been fixed (most likely, test them out):
- Players can now move on resurrection
- The auto infantry and the sentry have slower attack rates now
- Players will now always spawn on the same side unless you pick "Enemy"
- The game window can now be size adjusted
Pending functions:
- Engineer dragging players
- Robots can't climb the slope block
- Button to remove the auto infantry
- Button to make robots "spin in place" (take less damage)
- Make economy and experience visible to the player
Known Bugs: 
- The missile and drone now both spawn on the ground.
- Robots can sometimes climb railings

#Only if you want to try to older version
<b>To all that don't use Github but still want to try it out:
On page load, simply click on "Clone or Download", Then "Download ZIP". Find the "Robomaster.exe" file, and you're good to go.</b><br>
Known Bugs:
1) The drone has grossly unrealistic physics, and does not activate according to gamerules.
2) Bullet paths are way too accurate
3) UI Colours aren't stable. 
<br><br>
Things that will be added later on
1) More options for the spectator
2) A pinging system so you can play without having to Voice chat.

And much more.
