# Simulation 2020 (Version 1.2)!
The Robomaster Simulation by Wai Yan.
Version 1.2.<br>
<b>To all that don't use Github but still want to try it out:
On page load, simply click on "Clone or Download", Then "Download ZIP". Find the "Robomaster.exe" file, and you're good to go.</b><br>
Known Bugs:
1) The drone has grossly unrealisitc physics
2) Bullet paths are way too accurate
3) Cooldowns only work for Infantry; all other robots have the same configuration which I still need to code.
4) (I'm pretty sure) player damage is hard to tell.<br><br>
Things that will be added later on
1) All the different cooldown-buff areas around the map
2) End-game screen instead of just a Game Over.

And much more.
