# Simulation
The Robomaster Simulation by Wai Yan and Enzo.
Known bugs: 1) The Hero has no ammo.
2) The healthbar doesn't sync up.
3) There is no start timer and the game has no end.
4) The environment around the playfield is a horrendous sight, and players can go places you can't actually go in the real race.
And much more.
