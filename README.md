# Simulation 2020 (Version 1.2)!
The Robomaster Simulation by Wai Yan.
Version 1.2.<br>
<b>To all that don't use Github but still want to try it out:
On page load, simply click on "Clone or Download", Then "Download ZIP". Find the "Robomaster.exe" file, and you're good to go.</b><br>
Known Bugs:
1) The drone has grossly unrealisitc physics
2) Bullet paths are way too accurate
3) Cooldowns areas aren't cooling down as intended.
4) (I'm pretty sure) player damage is hard to tell.<br><br>
Things that will be added later on
1) A timer so it's actually 7 minutes and not just indefinitely stuck in game.
2) End-game screen instead of just a Game Over.
3) More options for the spectator

And much more.
